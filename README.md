## TL;DR

Let's start with an example.

Assume the we have the file named `example-tree.json` in the current directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, world!",
  "dir": {
    "subfile": "Content.\n",
    "subdir": {}
  },
  "symlink": ["link", "target path"],
  "script": ["script", "#!/bin/sh\necho Howdy!"]
}
```

And then, after installing `json2dir`, we run this command:

```sh
cat example-tree.json | json2dir
```

Here, four files will be added to the current directory:

- `greeting`: a regular file containing the text `Hello, world!`.
- `dir`: a directory with two entries in it (`subfile` and `subdir`).
- `symlink`: a symbolic link pointing to `target path`.
- `script`: an executable shell script that prints `Howdy!` when run.

Learn the [conversion scheme](#conversion-scheme) for more details.

## Use cases

Since `json2dir` accepts any JSON, it has a variety of use cases with other tools that can generate JSON.

### Managing dotfiles with Nix

`json2dir` can be used together with `nix profile` as a `home-manager` replacement for managing dotfiles. [Explanation](./home.md).

## Conversion scheme

### Objects

Objects represent directories. Keys of objects represent names of files in directories. The JSON document as a whole must be an object.

#### Examples

An empty directory: `{}`.

A directory with an empty directory named `foo`: `{"foo": {}}`.

### Strings

String values represent contents of files.

#### Examples

A directory with a file named `hello` with the text `Hello, world`: `{"hello": "Hello, world"}`.

### Arrays

Arrays represent symlinks and files with an executable bit set (executable files, scripts). Such files are not supported on Windows.

The first element of the array must be a string.

If the string is `"link"`, the second array element represents the target of the symlink.

If the string is `"script"`, the second array element represent the contents of the executable file.

#### Examples

A symbolic link pointing to the root directory: `["link", "/"]`.

An executable file printing `Hello` when ran: `["script", "#!/bin/sh\necho Hello"]`.

## Design considerations

- **UTF-8**: regular JSON constraints apply. In particular, unicode strings are interpreted as UTF-8. Currently, there's no way to represent files containing non-UTF-8 content.
- **Time of check, time of use attacks**: when using this utility to create files for other users, care must be taken in order to prevent TOCTOU (time of check, time of use) attacks (e.g. with symlinks). `json2dir` makes no attempt to guard against such attacks.
- **Deletion**: `json2dir` tries to delete a file or a directory before overwriting it.
- **String paths with multiple segments**: currently rejected, nested objects should be used instead.
- **String paths with special segments**: rejected. This is a basic measure to prevent rooted paths, therefore all paths must be relative.

## Installing

`json2dir` can be installed in multiple ways.

### With Cargo

Run `cargo install json2dir`.

### With Nix

Run `nix profile add github:alurm/json2dir`. Run `cachix json2dir` to use the Cachix cache.

## Development

To build the project, run `cargo build` or `nix build`. If you're using `rustup`, `rust-toolchain.toml` is provided.

Useful scripts may be found in the `scripts` folder.

Feel free to fork the project, open issues, submit PRs.
